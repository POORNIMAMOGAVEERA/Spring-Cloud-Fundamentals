In distributed environment we have bunch of microservices running. If one of the services stop working the entire application goes down<br />
We want the services to retry and handle the errors gracefully, That's where Resilence4j comes in and allows the application to do *fault tolerance* <br />

# Dependencies
- spring-boot-starter-actuator
